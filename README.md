1. Project to be done alone or in teams of 2 students.

2. Refer to the recording of the Nov. 20 class for more details and demos of possible projects.

3. There is no fixed topic for this project, no sample outputs, no exact requirements to match.

4. You have to choose your own topic. It can be a game, such as tic-tac-toe or mastermind, as suggested in class, or any other program, not necessarily a game.

5. It should be at least as big and need as much work as a regular assignment.

6. If you are not sure if your idea is appropriate for this project, then discuss with the teacher to make sure.

7. You have to use Python, with some extra packages if necessary. If you are not sure about which packages to use for a given task, ask the teacher for advice.

8. You can reuse some of the code presented in class or from your other assignments.

9. Main grading criteria:
    - **Works or not:** no crashes, the input is validated, it does what it's supposed to do
    - **Scope:** there's a significant amount of work done, at least as much as a regular assignment
    - **Code:** using good programming constructs (variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.), code well organized

Extensions, without penalty, are possible until Dec. 22.
